# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
Matching Paths for /products/:id


/products:
Does not match. The path /products/:id expects a segment after /products to match the :id parameter.


/products/apple:
Matches. The segment apple will be captured as the id parameter.

/products/5:
Matches. The segment 5 will be captured as the id parameter.


/products/5/about:
Does not match. The path /products/:id expects exactly one segment after /products. The additional /about segment means it does not match.
