# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer
The "*" path in React Router is used to match any route that does not match any of the defined routes. It is typically used to handle 404 Not Found pages. This ensures that if a user navigates to a URL that does not correspond to any of the specified routes, they are presented with a custom 404 page.
```js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import NotFound from './NotFound';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="*" component={NotFound} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```
